A MacOS notifier that opens up VS Code whenever you are specific websites for a certain amount of time

Uses Python and AppleScript ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

# How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Change website names if necesarry, change time to fit your needs

# Best Practices
Try to not have this running at all times and I recommend that you give yourself more than 5 seconds to view twitter lol 

This could also be used to open up other applications on macOs just make sure you edit with the appropriate application name like "Notes" , "Anki" , or "Steam"
